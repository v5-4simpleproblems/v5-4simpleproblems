# 4SP
**Creation Date:** March 13, 2025

4SP is a student-focused web platform that has evolved through five major versions since its creation. Version 1, released on March 13, 2025, began as a simple two-page website featuring a soundboard with 26 sounds—22 standard and 4 explicit—and a sound request page. Version 2, released on April 11, 2025, significantly expanded the platform with 36 pages, introducing games, playlists, proxies, and multimedia content, although many pages were experimental and the repository was cluttered; it also included a pirated copy of the Minecraft Movie, which was removed in later versions. Version 3, released on May 15, 2025, focused primarily on visual redesign, changing from a black-and-white scheme with blue highlights and the Roboto Mono font to a lighter white-and-grey palette using the Outfit font, with minimal functional changes. Version 4, released on August 22, 2025, represented a turning point, introducing a dark grey-and-white color scheme with purple highlights, a sidebar and apps section within a dashboard layout, widgets, games, and features such as Tab Disguising and a Panic Key; several experimental pages, including proxies, were removed, resulting in a more structured and feature-rich user experience. Version 5, released on December 2, 2025, is a complete rebuild designed to be professional and student-friendly, with a reduced page clutter, customizable navigation bar, sign-in via Google, Microsoft, GitHub, and X (Twitter), game data management, and a Games Collection featuring over 1,600 games. Version 5 is fully completed and live.  

Following the appearance of a new threat where school administrators could block the URLs via Securly, we have begun creating **Version 5 DV (Downloadable Version)**. This version will implement a fully downloadable 4SP client with secure code-based authentication, CDN-hosted files, device binding, cloud functions for code generation and redemption, and enhanced security measures, with a planned completion by the end of Christmas Break, 2025.
