# 4SP
**Creation Date:** March 13, 2025

4SP is a student-focused web platform that has evolved through five major versions since its creation. Version 1, released on March 13, 2025, began as a simple two-page website featuring a soundboard with 26 sounds—22 standard and 4 explicit—and a sound request page. Version 2, released on April 11, 2025, significantly expanded the platform with 36 pages, introducing games, playlists, proxies, and multimedia content, although many pages were experimental and the repository was cluttered; it also included a pirated copy of the Minecraft Movie, which was removed in later versions. Version 3, released on May 15, 2025, focused primarily on visual redesign, changing from a black-and-white scheme with blue highlights and the Roboto Mono font to a lighter white-and-grey palette using the Outfit font, with minimal functional changes. Version 4, released on August 22, 2025, represented a turning point, introducing a dark grey-and-white color scheme with purple highlights, a sidebar and apps section within a dashboard layout, widgets, games, and features such as Tab Disguising and a Panic Key; several experimental pages, including proxies, were removed, resulting in a more structured and feature-rich user experience. Version 5, currently in beta and scheduled for release by the end of Thanksgiving Break, 2025, is a complete rebuild designed to be professional and student-friendly. It reduces page clutter with a customizable navigation bar, supports sign-in via Google, Microsoft, GitHub, and X (Twitter), and introduces Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), game data management, a pin button, and the Games Collection, which aggregates over 1,600 games from two external websites, including GN-Math and StrongdogXP, alongside an “Others” section featuring HTML-based games such as Eaglercraft, the original Grand Theft Auto (JS-DOS and fanmade), Doom, and SimCity 1 and 2000. Version 5 was developed rapidly following the temporary blocking of Version 4 in October 2025, transforming the project from a concept into a fully realized platform within a single month to maintain user engagement and interest.
